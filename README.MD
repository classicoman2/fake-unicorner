# Unicorner
A great npm package with which you can say who is an unicornno
- Based on [this post](https://dev.to/christopherkade/building-a-cli-with-yargs-ip8)

## Example
```bash
    $ fake-unicorner set -n Pepe
```

## npm package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/fake-unicorner

## TODO
- [ ] Structure the project in `cli` and `server` like in `json-server` 
- [ ] Express: work with `.json` files (sync/async) - find people and say they're unicorns too
- [ ] Build: to a ` /lib` folder
- [ ] Use `husky` to lint and build before commit
- [ ] Publish package in Github repo section `Packages`, [more info here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages)
